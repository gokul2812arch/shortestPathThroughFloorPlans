# shortestPathThroughFloorPlans
find the shortest path through floor plans (png) 


for more info see https://www.notion.so/Shortest-Paths-Through-a-floor-plan-0fdc9a8899144319a7d186433204e4cb

run the file show_image.py 

you can import any png or jpeg that you want ,  curently it is set to detect (0,0,0) as obstacle other colours will be ignored 

you can change the scalle of the grid for more accuracy 

search algorithm used is BFS

click with mouse to select start and end point 

and space bar to refresh the image 


maze-generator.py   to generate a maze pattern (uses a dfs approach to generate maze using backtracking)

maze-solver-bfs.py  solve maze generated above using bfs (add a A, B in the txt file to indicate start and end position)

maze-solver-dfs.py  solves maze using dfs
